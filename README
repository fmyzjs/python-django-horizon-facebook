To install this plugin you need to update a couple settings and templates
in your dashboard deployment.

1. update the dashboard settings
Add 'horizon.facebook' to INSTALLED_APPS
Add 'horizon.facebook.backend.FacebookBackend' to AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS
define:
AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE = 'horizon.facebook.FacebookProfile'

2. update the dashboard local_settings (this could go in settings too)

Add these to your dashboard local_settings file
and populate there values with appropriate data
FACEBOOK_APP_ID = ""
FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET = ""
FACEBOOK_SCOPE = "email"
ADMIN_USER = ""
ADMIN_TENANT = ""
ADMIN_PASSWORD = ""
MEMBER_USER_ROLE = ""
DATABASES = {'default': {'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
                         'NAME': '',
                         'USER': '',
                         'PASSWORD': ''}}

then sync db so that the db tables are created.
horizon doesn't use a database so the above includes a database stanza


3. update the dashboard's urls.py

Add a line to the dashboard's urls.py like this to add the facebook urls in
    url(r'facebook/', include('horizon.facebook.urls')),

if there's a line that looks like url(r'', ....) the you need to put it
above that line or the facebook code will never get called.


4. overwrite templates if you want to.

the templates in horizon/facebook/templates aren't actually used there.
they are doctored a bit to add a facebook link and let the errors messages
bubble up when facebook login fails.

You'll find an identical tree in horizon/templates overwrite the ones in the
horizon/templates tree with the files from horizon/facebook/templates that
you find useful to deploy your facebook integration.
